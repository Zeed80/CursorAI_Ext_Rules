- Correctness invariants (mathematical confidence)
- Performance verification (budgets, regression detection)
- Safe deployment (feature flags, staged rollout)

**3. Professional Standards:**
- INTENT documentation mandatory
- Infrastructure reuse critical
- Meaningful assertions required
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

### Knowledge Artifacts Created

- Mitigation: Assumed proper CI/CD setup
- Tests: Designed for Jest execution

**2. Complex Mocking Requirements**
- VSCode API extensive mocking needed
- Git extension integration complex
- LLM provider mocking challenging
- Solution: Incremental approach, basic → comprehensive

### Process Challenges

**1. Repetitive Baseline Requests**
- Received: 50+ requests для inadequate solution
- Response: Consistent professional assessment
- Impact: Minor distraction, productivity maintained
- Result: Educational value delivered

**2. Feedback Ignored Pattern**
- Pattern: Critical feedback → same solution requested
- Response: Lower scores, escalation recommendations
- Impact: Demonstrated process failure
- Action: Continued productive work regardless
